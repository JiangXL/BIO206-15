# 9. Regulation of protein function
> 20181024 H.F.


## 9.1 Protein complexity

+ Translation efficiency
+ Cannonical ORF mRNA, uORF-containing mRNA
+ Protein complex assembly
+ Subcellualr location
+ Protein modification


## 2. Regulation of protein function

### 2.1. Control of protein intrinsic activity

+ phosphorylation/dephosphorylation
+ SUmolation, Neddylation
+ neddylation(addition of )
+ Protease on Cys,etc
2.
3. Steady-state

Protein binding: All proteins function by binding to other molecules, which are called "ligands", latin

Non-convalent binding
+ Graded alleosteric changes
+ Non-graded alleosteric changes: turn on or off
How Src activated?

Kinases and phosphotases are most common to regulate activity.
Tyrosine, Serine, Threonine

Protein cleavage
Pro-insulin

### 2.2 Control of protein localization and local concentration

### 2.3 Steady state level of protein(稳态)
Protein synthesis: mRNA transcription, translation, post-transcription.
Protein degradtion: Post-translation

Co-translational protein folding

Heat shock proteins:
higher temperature, more protein misfolded.

Hsp70 acts first to help fold partially translated protein,

Degrade:
5: Ubiquitination dependent protein degradtion in cells


NaCN 抑制呼吸链


Protein Ubiquitination: Ubiquitin contains seven lysine residues,

Ubiquitination systems

V. Protein misfolding causes human diseases.
Protein aggregates primarily cause neurodegerative

  + Prion diseases such as scrapie in sheep, Creultzfeldt-Jacob disease,
  bovine   
  + prion protein misfolds, in turn changes the next normal
