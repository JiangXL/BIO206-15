# 21. Cancer I

Most Cancers Derive from a Single Abnormal Cell

When the DNA at the site of translocation is cloned and sequencsd, it is found
that the site of breakage and
rejoining of the translocated fragments is identical in all the leukemiccc cells in any given ptient,
but that this sites differs slightly from one patient to another. This is the expected result if. and only
if, the cancer in each patient arises from a unique accident occurring in a single cell.

A single mutation is not enough to change a normal cell into a cancer cell.
If only a single muation were required to trigger the cancer and this cancer would be the same at all
ages. But in fact, for most types of cancer, the incidence rises steeply with age.
