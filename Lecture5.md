# Lecture 5: Membrane transport of ions and small molucules

## 

Ions are distubuted diferently indsid and outsixe a cell

### Simple diffusion
1.
	diethylurea: k=0.1	urea: k=0.001

### Two transport proteins
Tansporter and channel

electrochemical gradient is important factor(how to model)


Passive : down the electrochemical gradietn
Active: against the ele
ATP driven pump, coupled transporter,

### Channel
1. onogated (常开)
2. 10^7-10^8

ion-channel

Mean: maintain appropriate solute concentration to avoid osmotic swelling

## Aquaporins increase the water 

Water can transfer, but ASN on water channel stop the transfer of H+. 

## Ion Channel
1. Highly selective, >100 types

2u. High wefficency
+ 3. Tight close and open
voltage-gated, ligand-gated(extracelluar lighd), ligand-gated(intracelluar ligand), mechnically gated
(hair cell of ear)

### Transporter

+ 4.Uniport, antiport, symport 

### 1. Uniporter-GLUT1


### ATP-pumps
+ ATPase
+ 

### Symporter

Symporteer couple ithe Na and H+ gradient in trasport
Glucose can help to transfer in help with Na+

### Antiporter - a way for cells regulate PH
+ Na+/H+ exchange
+ Na+-driven Cl-/HCO3-exchange


### ATP pumps
+ 1. P-type(pho):
	+ Ca2+
	+ Ca2+ ATPase
	+ Na+ /K+ pumpb
+ 2. F-type:
+ 3. V-type:
+ 4. ABC-type(): 
	+ CFTR
	+
