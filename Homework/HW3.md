A: No essential.

B: Muatants with total loss of PKA can still obtain wld type PKA through wild
type strain in the hybrid, therefore mutants with total loss of PKA is recessive
mutant PKA regulatory subunits need higher concentration of cAMP to be
activated, even though it fuse with wild type strain these mutant PKA regulartory
subunits still exist. therefore these mutans are dorminant.

C: This results indicate that cells don't tolerate hyperactive PKA activity, but
it can tolerate loss of PKA activity, indicating that PKA is not essential for
cells. If cAMP has critical roles other than regulating PKA activity, they should decrease the cAMP levels in cells and see how cells respond to this
chagne. However, in this study, they did not perfoorm this experiment, therefore,
it does not support this notion.

## 3.
PDK-activated Akt directly or indirectly caused the phosphorylation of Akt on
S473.

## 4.
This is due to different receptors recognize different cargoes. Differenet
adaptor proteins bind to diferent receptors and then recruit clathrin to
assembly different vesicles. This whole process is also facilitated by the
membrane PI phosphorylation status which could be recognized by small GTPase,
allowing precise assembly and targeting of the vesicles. Even though they share
then same coating protein, the effector proteins and local environment are all
different.

## 5
* Serves as a timer for protein degradation;
* Keep cells in distance, prevent aggregation;
* Paly roles in celluar signaling.

## 6
Using a GFP tag or other fluorescence probes track the movement of proteins in
cells. Proteins vary  types of modifications of maturation patterns. Different
processing will take different enzyems to work on the cargo proteins, which result
in different time to take.

## 7
At neutral pH, the Fe ion can be recongnized by the transferrin and bind to it,
this is followed by the recongnition of Fe-transferrin receptor on the cell
surface. This is followed by the endocytosis. At the endosomes,pH became lower,
Fe will dissociate from transferrin, but the transferrin will remain in a complex
which transferrin receptors. This complex will then by recycled back to the
plasma membrane for exocytosis, transferrin will then dissociate with the
receptors at neutral pH. Finally, Fe is taken into cells for use.

## 8
 May be:
 * The point mutation causes blockage of secretory vesicles to fuse with the
 plasma membrane.
 * The mutation causes the failure of antitrypsin to be assembled into secretory
 vesicle.
 * This mutation may cause antitrypsin vesicle to failed targeted into the
 golgin apparatus.

 Tagging antitrypsin mutant with GFP and ovserve its route in vesicle traffic.
