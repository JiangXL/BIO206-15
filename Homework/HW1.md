## 1. Distinguish
Anaylsis the amnino acid kind of protein, the base of DNA and RNA

## 2. 
DNA is double helix complementary stranded. The virus don't obey Chargaff's rules,
because DNA of this virus is single-stranded.

## 3. 
Replication: A. DNA --> DNA
Transcription: B. DNA --> RNA
Translation : G. RNA --> protein

## 4.
(Model organism, 2), (procaryote, 6), (Eucaryote, 5), 	
(virus, 1), (Archarea, 3), (Homolog, 4)


## 5. 
A. Because extra copies will decrese the mutation of origin genes,
which don't contribute the evolution of new genes.

## 6.
Find out wheather some gene code function which is only repsobile
to important life activity of the  original mitochondrial endosymbiont.

## 7.
Trypin and collagenase both is proteolytic enzymes,which digest proteins in the 
extracellular matrix. EDTA will bind or chelate the Ca2+ on which cell-cell adhesion 
depends.

## 8.
Yes. If the antibody is kind of protein, it maybe easy to assmbly other antibody to against
it.

## 9
[FRET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%B6rster_resonance_energy_transfer#/media/File:FRET_Jabolinski_Diagram.svg)

Most important theory is Förster resonance energy transfer(FRET).
The energy of CFP's emission transfer to excite YFP. Cameleon link CFP and YFP together.
The form of camelelon is depended on Ca2+ concentration, which decise the efficiency of 
energy transfer.

One is isoelectric focusing, another is SDS-PAGE. 2d polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis
can imporve the revolution of result, which can be separated using isoelectric, protein
complex mass.
