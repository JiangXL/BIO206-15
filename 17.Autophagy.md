# 17 Autophage
> 20181207 HF

Autophage is the natural, regulated, destructive mechanism of the cell that
disassembles unnecessary or dysfunctional components. Autophagy allows the
orderly degradation and recycling of cellular components. In macroautophagy,
targeted cytoplasmic constituents are isolated from the rest of the cell within
a double-membraned vesicle known as an autophagosome. The autophagosome
eventually fuses with lysosomes and the contents are degraded and recycled.
Three forms of autophagy are commonly described: macroautophagy,
microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). In disease, autophagy
has been seen as an adaptive response to stress, which promotes survival,
whereas in other cases it appears to promote cell death and morbidity. In the
extreme case of starvation, the breakdown of cellular components promotes
cellular survival by maintaining cellular energy levels. The name "autophagy"
was coined by Belgian biochemist Christian de Duve in 1963. The identification
of autophagy-related genes in yeast in the 1955.

## History

Ubiquitin/ proteosome system:
        specific target recogniton; short-lived proteins
Lysome/ vacuolar systemï¼š
        obsolete/damaged orgranelle, bulk and non-selective; long-lived proteins

1955, Christian de Duve discovery lysosome.

## Meaning of autophagy
Nutrient Recycling:
 - 1). essential for survival under starvation
 - 2). recyling for amino acids for protein synthesis, energy source

Elimination of excessive or harmful materials:
  - 1).essential for clearance of cytoplasm
  - 2).specific protein, protein aggregates
  - 3).organelles: mitochondria, peroxisomes, lysosoems, ER nucleus
  - 4).Invasive bacterai, Virus particles.
