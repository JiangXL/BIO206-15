# 18. Integrating cells in Tissues
Four major types of tissues: Epithelial tissue, Connective tissues, Neuron
tissue, Muscle tissue.

Cell junction and adhesion are very important for multicellular organisms. It
allow cells to aggregate into distinct tissues and bidirectional communication
between interior and exterior of cells.

Here are four major types of junctions, anchoring junctions, occluding junction
channel-forming junctions and signal relaying junctions.
## I. Overview of cell-cell and cell-ECM junction and adhesion.

## II. Caderins(钙粘素) and cell-cell adhesion

## III. Integrins(整联蛋白) in cell-ECM adhesion
