# What is cell biology

Physiology-->Cell Biolog--> Biochemistry

**What can Cell biology can tell us?**

+ The mystery of longevity
+ The mystery of human diseases
+ Premature mortality(早产死亡) in China
+ Tumour: p53 gene

Signal --> Cytoskeleton --> Cell cycle --> Cell death -->
ECM adn Cell Adhesion --> Neouron --> Cancer --> Membrane --> Protein transport


## 1.1 Discovery of cell and the Cell theory

+ 1665 Hooks' Microscope
+ 1670: leeuwenhoek make a better microscope to observe more living thing
+ 1838-1839: Schieiden and Schwann general the role of cell in living thing
+ 1855 Rudolf Virchow: Propsed cells are from pre-existing cells
+ 1860s:Louis Pasteur proved that cell only originated from  an pre-existing living cell
+ 1880 : Eduard Strasburger observe the cell division

**The Cell Theory**

+ 1. All living are composed of one or more cells.
+ 2. The cell is basic unit of structure and function for all organisms.
+ 3. All cells arise only from preexisting cells by division

## 1.2 The difference between prokaryotic cell and eukaryotic cell

Most cells are small. Prokaryotic is about 0.2~2 micrometer, eukaryotic 10~100 micrometer.
> For prokoyote, genes are temporally regulated ; for eukoryote, gene are also
regulated in spatial dimension.

> "eu"     --> "true","good"
> "karyote --> "kernel"
> "pro"    --> "before"

| Characteristic   | prokaryotes   | eukaryotes |
|------------------|---------------|------------|
|   Size    | 0.2-2.0 micrometer in diameter | 10-100micrometer |
| Nucleus   |  x                             | ALL              |
|Organelles |  x                             | ER, Golgin bodies, Lysosome |
|Phospholipid membrane |                     | mitochondrial, chloroplasts |
|Motility   | rotating Flagell(some)         | undulated Flagella & Cilia arrangement microtubles others by amboid action |
|Glycocalyx | capsule, slime layer           | Surround some animal cells   |
| Flagella  | some                           | some                         |
| Cillia    | x                              | some                         |
| Fimbriae & pill | some                     | some                         |
| Cell Wall | most, bacteria                 | most: protein, cellulose, algin agar, carrageenan, sillicate, glucomanna, chitin|
| Plasma membrane| Lacking carbs and sterols | has: glycoprotein,glycolipids,sterols |
| Cytosol   | ALL                            | ALL                           |
| Inclusions | ALL                           | ALL                           |
| Endospores | some                          | x                             |
| Ribosomes  | Cytoplasm(70s)                | Cytoplasm(80s) Mitochondria&Chlroplast(80s)|
| Cytoskeleton | simple                      | complex |
| Cell divison | amitosis                    |mitosis & meiosis|
| Biochemical diversity | much more          | much less|

So, the best description  of  the size of a yeast cell is 10-100micrometer


### Structure of an animal cell

Cells visuallied by microscope.

## 1.3 The astonishing constancy of all cells

+ 1. All cells use DNA to store gentic information.
+ 2. Central dogma: All cells transcribe DNA into RNA, and translates RNA into
 potein. Protein synthesis from messenger RNA by ribosomes.
+ 3. All cells require free energy, make and consume ATP to drive the life.
+ 4. All cells are enclosed in a plasma membrane

## 1.4 How did cells evolve?

Evidence to support symblosis: Mitochondria.
Genetic information determines the nature of whole nulticellular organisms. Gene is
the one which can code protein, RNA or others. Mutation, duplication, shuffling,
Horizontal gene transfer, which can change the info of DNA. Horizontal gene transfer(HGT)
occurs in prokaryotic cells (same species or between species), which contians
transformation, conjugation, transduction, by sex.

** Homologous genes(genes are homologs):**

+ orthologs(��λ��): Speciation to give to two separate speices
+ paralogs����λ����: Gene duplication and divergence

HGT: Transduction, transfofmation, commgation
sex is horizontal gene tra
