## 5.1 Principles of Membrane transport

Ions are distubuted diferently indsid and outside a cell.

In simple diffusion, some molecules can simple cross the lipid bilayer by
diffusion. diffusion rate depends on concentration, hydrophobicity & size,
which is influenced by the electrical gradient.

> electrochemical gradient is important factor(how to model)

O2, CO2, N2, steroid, hormones are hydrophobic and small uncharge polar
molecules which are free pass the hydrophobic liqid bilayer. But lots of
materials can not pass throgh membrane, **channels** & **transporters** are two
major classes of membrane protein to help these molecules accross membranes.
Channels don't change conformation during transport, but transporter do it.
They play different role.

**Passive transport** down the electrochemical gradient. **Active transport**
against the electrochemical gradient. Here are 3 kind of active transport: 
ATP driven pump, coupled transporter, light-driven transport.

| Channels      | Transporters      | Energy-driven pumps 
|---------------|-------------------|---------------------
| always passive transport | facilite molecule against/down gradient | against
| low binding affinity     | hight binding affinity      | requires energy
| $10^7$-$10^8$ ions/second| $10^2$ - $10^4$ ions/second | 1-1000 inos/second


Active transport is mediated by transporters coupled to an energy Source. There
are three main types: uniport, antiport, symport. Transport undergo
comformational changes, binding molecules more tighly, low speed.


## 5.2 Channels: A super efficent protein
Always do passive transport. nogated (open most of time)
huage capacity 10^7-10^8 ion per second

To maintain appropriate solute concentration to avoid osmotic swelling, cell
use different ways. Animal cell export of ions, plant cell stabilized by rigd
cell wall and protozoan export of water by discharging contractile vacuole.

Here are two typical channels: **water channel**(aquanporins) and 
**ion channels**. Water channel buid up a hyrophilic pore to transfer water, but
two Asparageines on water channel techer two water and prohibit H+ to pass.

![ASN stop H+ relay](5/WaterChannel2.png)

Ion Channel: 1). Highly selective, >100 types 2). High efficency, 100 million
ions/second 3). Tight close and open(fluctuation!) Here 4 ways to open the
"gate": voltage-gated, ligand-gated(extracelluar lighd), 
ligand-gated(intracelluar ligand), mechnically gated (hair cell of ear)

Ion channels: high efficiency... voltage gated, mechanically gated. Such as the
mechanical gated channel. 

How the K+ channel work


## 5.3 Transporters: great helper, but nothing is for free...
Change conformation, bind molecules more tightly, 100-10000 molecules/second.
Here are three main types: _Uniporter_, _Symporter_, _Antiporter_.

Uniporter-GLUT1(The)

Bacteriorhodopsin: 

**Symporteer** couple ithe Na and H+ gradient in trasport. Glucose can help to
transfer in help with Na+. 

**Lactost permease**: symport of lactose and H+ in E.Coli

**Antiporter** - a way for cells regulate PH.

+ export H+: Na+/H+ exchange
+ import/export HCO3-: Na+-driven Cl-/HCO3- exchange; Na+-indenpent Cl-HCO3-
exchange acidify.


## 5.4 ATP Pumps: molecular machines
All pumps are active transporters. Here are 3 types pumps as following.

1. P-type(pho):
	+ Ca2+ pump(endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotic cell)
	+ Ca2+ ATPase
	+ Na+ /K+ pumpb
	+ H+ /K+ pump
2. F-type:
3. V-type:
4. ABC-type():
	+ CFTR
P-type pump is different with F-type pump.

**P-type pump**: they phosphorylate themsleves during pumping cycle. Such as,
the Ca2+ pump or Ca2+ ATPase. Phosphorylation of the Ca2+ pump induces the
conformational change that drive pumping. 

The Na+-K+ ATPse is a major regulator of osmolarity and it is an electrogenic
pump: export 3 Na+ vs. 2 K+. First step: in the cyotosolic surface the
non-phosphorylated tarnsporter has high affinity for Na+ inos but only low
affinity for K+ ions. Second step: 

![Na-K pump](5/Sodium-potassium_pump.svg)

**ATP synthases** 

**V-ATPase**(vacuolar-type transporter): only 

**ABC transporter**: Multidrug resistance(MDR) protein is the first eukaryotic
ABC transporter indentifide. Cystic fiborosis transmembrane conductance
regulator(**CFTR**), which regulates open and close of Cl- channel and . 

## 5.5 Neuron electric potential
Membrane potential 
-20mV to -120mV

K+ channel 

Action potential: a depolorization signal on the plasma membrane --> Voltage-gated
Na+ channels open, cause influx of Na+ --> Opening of more Na+ channel, positive
feedback --> 

Slower kinectis than Na+ channel.

excitatroy neurotransmitters open cation channels, causing influx of Na+ and
firing of action petential. Inhibitory neurotransmitters open Cl- or K+ channels,
casusing delays of action potential.

| Snake toxins | bind to acetylcholine receptors and inhibit them
| Curare       | bind to acetylcholine recetpors
| Barbiturates transquilizers | bind to GABA receptors
| Prozac      | inihibits uptake of serotin
