# 5.Membrane transport of ions and small molucules


## Principles of Membrane transport

Ions are distubuted diferently indsid and outside a cell

### Simple diffusion
1. O2, CO2, N2, steroid, hormones; glucose, sucrose,
Slove
	diethylurea: k=0.1	urea: k=0.001

Rate dependent on concentration, electrochemical gradient


### Two transport protein 
Tansporter and channel

electrochemical gradient is important factor(how to model)


Passive : down the electrochemical gradietn
Active transprot against the electrochemical gradient. Here are 3 kind of active
transport: ATP driven pump, coupled transporter, light-driven transport.

| down its gradietn 10^7-10^8| bind molucules tightly, undergo confomationlchanges, |

### Channel: A super efficent protein.
1. onogated (open most of time)
2. huage capacity 10^7-10^8 ion per second

ion-channel

Mean: maintain appropriate solute concentration to avoid osmotic swelling

## Aquaporins increase the water

Water can transfer, but ASN on water channel stop the transfer of H+.

## Ion Channel
1. Highly selective, >100 types

2u. High wefficency
+ 3. Tight close and open
voltage-gated, ligand-gated(extracelluar lighd), ligand-gated(intracelluar ligand), mechnically gated
(hair cell of ear)

How the K+ channel work
�ѵ�������Ҫ��һ������ѡ����

Active transport is mediated by transporters coupled to an energy Source. There
are three main types: uniport, antiport, symport. Transport undergo
comformational changes, binding molecules more tighly, low speed.



### ATP pumps
All pumps are active 
+ 1. P-type(pho):
	+ Ca2+
	+ Ca2+ ATPase
	+ Na+ /K+ pumpb
+ 2. F-type:
+ 3. V-type:
+ 4. ABC-type():
	+ CFTR
	+

Thickness of lipid bilayer is about 5mm.

## 5.2 Channels
Here gap junctions, ion channels.

The water chanel. Water can transfer, but ASN on water channel stop the transfer
of H+.

Ion channels: high efficiency... voltage gated, mechanically gated. Such as the
mechanical gated channel. 

## 5.3 Transportes


Uniporter-GLUT1(The)

Bacteriorhodopsin: 

**Symporteer** couple ithe Na and H+ gradient in trasport. Glucose can help to
transfer in help with Na+. 

### Antiporter - a way for cells regulate PH
+ Na+/H+ exchange
+ Na+-driven Cl-/HCO3-exchange
