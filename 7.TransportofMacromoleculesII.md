## 7.1 Overview of vesicular traffic
All almost contains **exocytosis** and **endocytosis**. Membrane orientation
don't change during vesicular transport.(???)

Molecules undergo exocytosis in vesicular traffic：
+ Plasma membrane proteins:
  + Cell surface receptors
  + Transporters
  + Ion channels
+ Soluble protein
  + digestive enzymes
  + peptide hormones
  + collagen
  + ECM proteins, etc
+ From endosome to lysosome
  + unneeded protein
  + hydrolases: proteases, glycosidases, phosphatases,lipases
  + some amino acid for storage

Molecules undergo **endocytosis** 
Because large nutrient macromolecules is too large.

Vesicular traffic all mediated by Golgi apparatus: retrieval, secretory, 
endocytic pathway.

Why do transport vesicles need the coat protein? 1) Selection & concentration 
of specific proteins for transport. 2)Mold the vesicle. Assembly of

Budding vesicle as dictated by special coating protein.

hexagon(六边形)
Budding vesicle is dicatated by special coating protein, including
clathrin(网格蛋白), COPI, COPII.
Clathrin is made of 3 large and 3 small polypeptide chain, which assemble into
a "three-legged" triskelion. Adaptor proteins select cargo into clathrin-coated
vesicle. Different locations for PIPs to regulate targeted vesicular transport.
Membrane-bending proteins help deform the membrane during vesicle formation.
Dynamin mediated

CCV cargo is recoginzed by tetrameric adaptor. Membrane binding to open the
binding pocket for the cargo interaction. Then cargo binding. Finally, clathrin
recruitment.

Differential locations of phosphoinosittides(PIPs) regulate targeted vesicular
transport. After CCV budding, a cytosolic PI(5)P.

Curving membranes: brute force & ignorance. GTPase control.

Rab proteins direct the vesicle to the correct target sites. SNARE proteins 
mediate the fusion of the lipid bilayer. Rad-GDP is inactive and cytosolic,
usually bound to Rab-GDP-dissociation inhibitor(GDI). Rab proteins guide
transport vesicle to their target membrane. Activated by membrane bound Rab-GEF
(Guanine exchange factor) and become Rab-GTP(active form).

cascade(级联)

To ensure vesciles are targetd to specific site for fusion. Rab protein can
direct the vesicle to the correct target sites.SNAR.

Activation --> Recruitment

SNARES mediate membrane fusion.

Dissociation of SNARE pairs after membrane fusion requires ATP hydrolysis by 
the AAA-ATPase NSF(N-enthylmaleimide-sensitive-factor)

## 7.4 Transport from trans-Golgi to lysosome
Activation of many enzymes needs proteolytic cleavage and acidic environment. 
Lysosomes can found in all eukarotic cells, which can breakdown intra-and
extracelluar debris, destruction of phagocytosed microorgamism, and production
of nutrients for the cell.

Bid-
The recognition of a lysomal hydrolase: synthesis of the lysomal sorting signal.
Lysomal sorting signals on soluble lysosomal proteins emerge in the TGN.


So, how are hydrolases selected for transported to lysosomes?

## 7.5 Endocytosis
_Phagocytosis_ and _pinocytosis_ is two major types of **endocytosis**.
Phagocytosis is for large particle, a selective process, phagosomes are > 250nm
in diameter, is import to scavenge old and dead cells, and is important to eat
outside pathogens. Pinocytosis is for fluid and solute, a continuous process,
pinocytic vesicles ~100nm in diameter.

> A **macrophage** is "eating" two red blood cells, a macrophage can eat 10^11
old RBCs per day.

Antibody coated pathogens, complements in pathogens,

Pinocytosis occurs continuously and fast(several percent /min of
plasma membrane). Well balance between endocytosis and exocytosis should be
occurs in serval ways: clathrin-coated pits, caveolae mediated(believed to start
from lipid rafts).

Endocytosis mediated by Clathrin-coated pits, called receptor mediated
endocytosis. About 25 different receptors mediated this type of endocytosis.
Many different receptors cluster in the same pit. The same receptors can
cluster in different pits.

> Example: Taking up of cholesterol by LDL receptor on cells.

The endocytosed materials can be _recycling, transcytosis and degradation_.

Transcytosis transport material from one side of cytosis to other side.

> Glucose transporter can be relocalization

Multivesicular bodies derive from early endosome, move along Microtubles, then
turn to be late endosomes, which are targeted to degradation some.

Constitutive and regluated secretory pathways. 

> Exocytosis of secretory vesicles is import to cure HIV.
