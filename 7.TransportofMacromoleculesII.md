# 7. Transport of macromolecules II: Vesicular transport
> 20181010 H.F.

## 7.1 Overview of vesicular traffic
All almost contains **exocytosis** and **endocytosis**. Membrane orientation
don't change during vesicular transport.(???)

Molecules undergo exocytosis in vesicular traffic：
+ Plasma membrane proteins:
  + Cell surface receptors
  + Transporters
  + Ion channels
+ Soluble protein
  + digestive enzymes
  + peptide hormones
  + collagen
  + ECM proteins, etc
+ From endosome to lysosome
  + unneeded protein
  + hydrolases: proteases, glycosidases, phosphatases,lipases
  + some amino acid for storage

Molecules undergo **endocytosis** 
Because large nutrient macromolecules is too large.

Vesicular traffic all mediated by Golgi apparatus: retrieval, secretory, 
endocytic pathway.

Why do transport vesicles need the coat protein? 1) Selection & concentration 
of specific proteins for transport. 2)Mold the vesicle. Assembly of

Budding vesicle as dictated by special coating protein.

Budding vesicle is dicatated by special coating protein, including
clathrin(网格蛋白), COPI, COPII.
Clathrin is made of 3 large and 3 small polypeptide chain, which assemble into
a "three-legged" triskelion. Adaptor proteins select cargo into clathrin-coated
vesicle. Different locations for PIPs to regulate targeted vesicular transport.
Membrane-bending proteins help deform the membrane during vesicle formation.
Dynamin mediated

CCV cargo is recoginzed by tetrameric adaptor. Membrane binding to open the
binding pocket for the cargo interaction. Then cargo binding. Finally, clathrin
recruitment.

Differential locations of phosphoinosittides(PIPs) regulate targeted vesicular
transport. After CCV budding, a cytosolic PI(5)P.

Curving membranes: brute force & ignorance. GTPase control.

Rab proteins direct the vesicle to the correct target sites. SNARE proteins 
mediate the fusion of the lipid bilayer. Rad-GDP is inactive and cytosolic,
usually bound to Rab-GDP-dissociation inhibitor(GDI). Rab proteins guide
transport vesicle to their target membrane. Activated by membrane bound Rab-GEF
(Guanine exchange factor) and become Rab-GTP(active form).
