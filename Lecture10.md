fast
slow: protein change in protein behavior
Slow and fast respones.

The same signals trigger different effects. Such as acetylcholine receptors, secretion and contraction.

The same cell type reacts differently to different concentration of signals -- the signal in this case is called --- Morphogen.
Morphogen in development.

## 2 Intracelluar receptors
