# Lecture 16 Apoptosis

Apoptosis is form of programmed cell death. Apoptosis eliminates cells that are
abnormal, misplaced, nonfunction, or potentially dangerous. It a natural part of
organism devlopment and maintenance. For example, tissue/organ homeostasis(live
size), metamorphosis (tadopole to frog), tissue sculpting (mouse paw), immune
cell apoptsis (short-lived neutrophils).


During apotosis, cells undergo morphological changes: **Characteristics of apoptosis**
- Cell shrinkage and chromatin condensation
- PS flipping to outside
- DNA fragmentation
- Nuclear membrane disruption
- Cytoskeleton collapses
- Cell surface blebs(水泡)---apoptotic bodies

It is difference between apoptosis and necrosis. For apoptsis, cells die clean
and tidy(为了有序而清理). Necrosis is cauesed by acute insults(无法有序而混乱)

## II. Methods to identify apoptosis cell

**Annexin V staining**： PS is flipped to outer leaflet of plasma membrane and can
be detected by annexin V (protein)-conjugate fluorscent dye.

Cell cycle distribution, DNA fragmentation

**Terminal dUTP Nick End Labelling (TUNEL)**. 3' Terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase catalyzes dUTP addition on fragmented DNA, dUTP is subsequently
labeled with fluorescence dye.

## Brief History- leading to the Nobel Prize in 2002

Sydeny Brenner estabished *C. elegans* as a novel experimental model organism.
Because *C. elegans* is transported, scientists can observe cell division,
differentiation and organ development under microsocpe.

John Sulston: Cell death is part of the normal differentiation process

Robert Horvitz discovered and characterized key genes controlling cell death in
*C. elegans*.

Xiaodong Wangs' work revealed a key role(caspase-3 via apoptosome) for the
mitochondria in programmed cell death.

## IV:Players and mechanis

### 4.1 Caspases
**Apoptosis depends on an intracellular protolytic cascade.**
Signal-mediated cascading activation of apoptosis.

### 4.2 Activation cascade:
1) Apoptotic signal triggers, 2) Adaptor com

The amplifying caspase cascade: the point-of-no-return.
Here is 3 categories of human caspases.

### 4.3 Death receptor trigger the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis.

### 4.4 The intrinsic or mitochondria apoptosis activation pathway
Interactors & interactions
