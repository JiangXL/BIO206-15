# Lecture 16 Apoptosis

Apoptosis is form of programmed cell death. Apoptosis eliminates cells that are
abnormal, misplaced, nonfunction, or potentially dangerous. It a natural part of
organism devlopment and maintenance. For example, tissue/organ homeostasis(live
size), metamorphosis (tadopole to frog), tissue sculpting (mouse paw), immune
cell apoptsis (short-lived neutrophils).


**Characteristics of apoptosis**
- 1.Cell shrinkage and chromatin condensation
- 2.
During apotosis, cells undergo mor

## II. Methods to identify apoptosis cell

### 2.a) Annexin V staining
PS is flipped to outer leaflet of plasma membrane and can be detected by annexin
V (protein)-conjugate fluorscent dye.

### 2.b) Cell cycle distribution

### 2.c) DNA fragmentation

### 3.d) Tunel staining (late apoptosis)
Terminal dUTP Nick End Labelling (TUNEL). 3' Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase
catalyzes dUTP addition on fragmented DNA, dUTP is subsequently labeled with
fluorescence dye.

### 3.e) Western blot for apoptosis maker (Caspase 3, PARP, etc)
cleaved PARP, cleaved caspase-3
### 3.f) Cytochrome translocation


## Brief History- leading to the Nobel Prize in 2002

Sydeny Brenner estabished *C. elegans* as a novel experimental model organism.
Because *C. elegans* is transported, scientists can observe cell division,
differentiation and organ development under microsocpe.

John Sulston

Robert Horvitz discovered and characterized key genes controlling cell death in
*C. elegans*.

Xiaodong Wangs' work revealed a key role for the mitochondria in programmed
cell death.

## IV:Players and mechanis

### 4.1 Caspases
**Apoptosis depends on an intracellular protolytic cascade.**
Signal-mediated cascading activation of apoptosis.

### 4.2 Activation cascade:
1) Apoptotic signal triggers, 2) Adaptor com

The amplifying caspase cascade: the point-of-no-return.
Here is 3 categories of human caspases.

### 4.3 Death receptor trigger the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis.

### 4.4 The intrinsic or mitochondria apoptosis activation pathway
Interactors & interactions
