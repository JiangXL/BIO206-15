# Methods to study cell biology


## 1. Obtain pure cell culture

### 1.1 From authorative resource
| HeLa | epithelial cell(human) | Is it right to use carrer cell to study normal behavir|

### 1.2 Isolated from tissue
Dissected tissue
-->Add trypin/EDTA digest,collagenase digest
(Trypin and collagenase both is proteolytic enzymes,which digest proteins in the
extracellular matrix. EDTA will bind or chelate the Ca2+ on which cell-cell adhesion
depends )
-->...-->Flow cytometry

### 1.3 How to enrich homo genous cells
+ 1.3.1 FACS
+ 1.3.2 Magnetic beads-conjugated antibody. Example: Add CD3-magnetic beads conjugate
+ 1.3.3 Laser capture microdissection(�����и����)

## 1.4 Hybridoma cell line(�ӽ���ϸ��ϵ)

Fusion


## 2. Culture cells/maintain a cell line

Media:
+ 1. Buffer
+ 2. food source: Glucose, glutmine, amino acids, nucleotides, etc
+ 3. Serum/growth stimulat
+ 4. minerals for  
+ 5. Antibiotic additives and pH indicator(?)

RPMI, MCCoy's 5A, F12, etc

2D and 3D culture: 2D monolayer, 3D spheoids grown on matrix, 3D spheroids grown
within matrix or suspension

| | 2D | 3D |

| Cell Differentiation |

## 3. Composed of Cells
Chemical Componetn of CEll
1% DNA
4% mater


# 4. Method the study the functions of components in the cell

## 4.1 Proteins isolated chromoatorgraphy
## 4.2 Protein anaysis by SDS-PAGE

## 4.3 2-D protein analysis


## 4.4 How to analyze DNA/RNA
DNA/RNA can ve labeled
RNA FISH(RNA FLuo in situ hybridization?)

DNA FISH()

clone specific gene or anaylze gene expression levels?

RT-PCR()

Cell-free system - a relatively pure system
+ An in vitro system consists from pure biomoleculers or cerll homogentate
