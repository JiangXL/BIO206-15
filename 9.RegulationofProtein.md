# 9. Regulation of protein function
> 20181024 H.F. must read book for logic


## 9.1 Protein complexity

+ Translation efficiency
+ Cannonical ORF mRNA, uORF-containing mRNA
+ Protein complex assembly
+ Subcellualr location
+ Protein modification


## 9.2 Control of protein activity

+ phosphorylation/dephosphorylation
+ SUmolation, Neddylation
+ neddylation(addition of )
+ Protease on Cys,etc
2.
3. Steady-state

Protein binding: All proteins function by binding to other molecules, which
are called "ligands", latin: ligare means to "to bind"

Non-convalent binding
+ Graded alleosteric changes
+ Non-graded alleosteric changes: turn on or off
How Src activated?

Kinases and phosphotases are most common to regulate activity.
Tyrosine, Serine, Threonine. Phoshporylation and dephosphorylation is
reversible, allowing to switch the protein "ON" and "OFF".

Protein cleavage is irreversible modification: petide hormons, zymogen(inactive
proenzymes), firbrous proteins.


## 9.3 Steady state level of protein(稳态)
Different proteins have different half life protein. Short half life protein,
such as cell cycle protein; long half life protein, house keeping genes such
as tubulin, actin.

Protein synthesis: mRNA transcription, translation, post-transcription.
Protein degradtion: Post-translation

Co-translational protein folding.

Heat shock proteins: rapidly induced by heat shock, higher temperature, more
protein misfolded. Hsp70 acts first to help fold partially translated protein,

Protein phosphorylation can provide signals for protein ubiquitination.


## 9.4 Ubiquitination and protein degradation

NaCN 抑制呼吸链. Ubiquitin itself contains seven lysine residues, mulitiple.
Polyubiquitinylated protein is then degraded by the proteasome in the cytosol.
Many proteins are degraded in a controllable manner.


## 9.5 Protein misfolding causes human diseases.
Protein aggregates primarily cause neurodegenerative.

+ Prion diseases such as scrapie in sheep, Creultzfeldt-Jacob disease,
bovine, spongiform encephalopathy(BSE)
+ Protein aggregate, huntingtons's disease Alzheimer's disease.
