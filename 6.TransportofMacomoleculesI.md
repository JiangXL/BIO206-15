## 6.1 Cell compartments

The major intracellular compartments of an animal cell
![Animal cell](6/Animal_cell_structure_en.svg)


The import of cell member system in cell
Why the explentd inner member? Because small surface/volume ratio

How cell shape is determined?

Sets of protein decide the function of
All the protein is made in cytosol

Infomate bettile, most protein without sorting stay in cytosol, protein with
sorting signal will be transproted by three way:

+ Gated transport:  proteins move betwween cytosol ans nucleus through nuclear
pore complex(NPC)
+ Transmembrane transport: 
+ Vesicular transport

Three kind of signal seq

+ N-terminal signal seq: 15-60 aa long,  import into plastid (one 亲水，疏水)
+ Internal Stretches of amnino acids
+ Signal path


## 6.2 Transprot between the nucleus and the cytosol
Bi-direction, both import and export. 
Any cargo with a nuclear lcalization singal(NLS) exposed will
destined for quick and efficient transport through the pore. Gnenerally
containing a conserved sequence with basci residues such as PKKKRKV.

摆渡人
Ran-GAP, Ran-GEF

example: T cell

> why exist nuclear fibrilin NPC


## 6.2 Transport in Mitochondrionand Choroplast
Fully synthesized in the cytosol before their import.

Why the complex are encode by both mtDNA and nucleus encode

Protein translocators --  TIM , TOM
TIM23, TIM

ATP and mebrane poteintal drive  import into the matrix space

chaperones(分子伴侣)，
gap

into outer

into inner


## Transport in peroxisome(过氧化物体）


## Transport in Endoplasmic reticulum
Co-translational:

Rough and smooth microsomes


## SRP( Signal Recognition Particle)
Three ways of protein translocation
+

## Multi-pass transmembrane proteins


## Some ER resident proteins
+ translocated polypeptide chains are folded and assemebled in the ER lumen.
+

## Rough ER-glycosylation
Misfolded proteisn in the ER activate an unfolded protein response.

Activation of transcription of genes involvd in unfolded protein response.

## Phospholipid synthesis in ER
Nearly all major lipids are synthesized in ER, including Phospholipid,choleserol, ceramide.

### Synthesis of phosphatidylcholine
### Symmetry and asymmetry in ER and plasma membrane.
### ER production of ceramide
