# Lecture 4 -- Membrane structure



## 1. Overview of membrane
+ Double membrane:
	nucleus, mitochondrion, chloroplast.
+ Single membrane: proxisome(过氧化物酶体), endoplasmic reticulum, lysosome, Golgi apparatus, plasma membrane, transport vesicle.

The  lipid bilayer is about 5nm thick.

Cell membrane act as selective barriers. relatively impermeable barrier, fluid,
dynamic, composed of protein and lipid.

Functions of plasma membrane include:
compartmentalization(划分), Scaffolding, Gatekeeper, Sensors of outside signals.
Energy transduction. So, the surface of membrane is not smooth.


## 2. Lipid bilayer

### 2.1 Lipid compostion overview
Phospholipids(PI, PE, PS, PC, Sphingomyelin), Cholesterol, Glycolipids...

Cholesterol's rigid ring make membrane less flexible and its long hydrocarbon tail
make lipids pack more tightly, but low concentration make lipids more fluid. At
higer temp, reduces fluidity; in low temp, prevent the tightening of the membrane.

Compostion in two layer of membrane is asymmery. The cytosolic side is negative.

### 2.7 Motion of the lipid molecules
Rapid change $~10^7/sec$, rotate very rapidly along the their long aixs, flip-flop
is very rare.

Lower organisms can adjust lipid compostion to keep membrane fluid at different env.

### 2.8. Phase transition of lipid menbrane
Gel phase --> Lipid Crytal Phase

### 2.9. Adipocyte-specialized(脂肪细胞) cell for lipid storage


## 3. Lipid assembly and Detergents
The power of assembly. Micelle or lipid bilayer forms in aquenous solution.

Detergents, SDS ionic detergent, Trition-X-100-non-ionic detergent, NP-40-non-ionic
Different concentration of detergent can form mic or
Black membrane and liposome

SDS: cover protein molecules with negative charges, fully denature protein,  dependent on the protein and SDS cont

Non-ionic detergent no denature protein , only solute protein


## 4. Membrane proteins
Type:  
	+ intergral membrane proteins,
	+ perriphery proteins
	+

+ me 30% genome
+ important therapeutic targets

c. Lipid-linked protein are made in cytosol as soluble proein
d. GPI anchor is made as transmembrane protein

Membrae protein asymmery:
+ Confomational changes of protein can occur
+ carbohydarteof glycoproty, is out

Membrane protein form domain:
+ self-assemble into aggregate
+ Tethered by outside molecules
+ Tethered by inside molecules
+ Confined by cell-cell junctions

Example: Cytosketon nework
Carbohydrate layer by ru

Glycoprotein
+ Lectins:

Membrane protein mobility
+ Rotaional mobility
+ Lateral difussion
	Example 2: FRAP 	
	Example 3: FLIP (what about the curve)

+ Protein moblility vary gratly
	(1) some  protein is free to move


## Membrane  proteins to covalently attach to membrane lipid
+ myristoyl anchor ��ޢ
+ palmitoys anchor
+ farnesyl anchor

Toplogy
	Example 1: mitocho
	Example 2: protein G

	Transmenbrane alpa-helix:
	can be predite by hydropath plot
