## The major intracellular compartments of an animal cell

## The import of cell member system in cell

Why the explentd inner member?

Sets of protein decide the function of
All the protein is made in cytosol

Infomate bettile, most protein without sorting stay in cytosol,

protein with sorting signal will be transproted by three way:
  + gated transport
  + transmembrane transport
  + vesicular transport

## Three kind of signal seq
  + N-terminal signal seq
    import into plastid (one 亲水，疏水)
  +  

## Transprot between the nucleus and the cytosol

why exist nuclear fibrilin NPC
NPC

## transport in mitochondrionand choroplast

Protein translocators --  TIM , TOM
TIM23, TIM

ATP and mebrane potintal drive  import into the matrix space

chaperones(分子伴侣)，

## Transport in peroxisome(过氧化物体）

## Transport in Endoplasmic reticulum

Co-translational:

Rough and smooth microsomes


## SRP( Signal Recognition Particle)
Three ways of protein translocation
+

## Multi-pass transmembrane proteins


## Some ER resident proteins
+ translocated polypeptide chains are folded and assemebled in the ER lumen.
+

## Rough ER-glycosylation

Misfolded proteisn in the ER activate an unfolded protein response.

Activation of transcription of genes involvd in unfolded protein response.

## Phospholipid synthesis in ER
Nearly all major lipids are synthesized in ER, including Phospholipid,choleserol, ceramide.

### Synthesis of phosphatidylcholine
### Symmetry and asymmetry in ER and plasma membrane.
### ER production of ceramide
