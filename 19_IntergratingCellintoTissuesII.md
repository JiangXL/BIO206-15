## I. Occluding(咬合) junctions


## II. Channel-forming junctions
Allow direct exchange of small molecules and inorganic ions
in the cytoplasm, but very few macromolecules in rare
exceptions. In animals, it form gap junctions; in plants, it form plasmodesmata.

## III. Basal Lamina(薄层)
4-120nm in thickness, mechanical role, determines cell polarity, influence cell
metabolism, cell survival, proliferation, migration and differentiation.

### 3.2 Composition of badsal lamina
Fibrous(纤维的) proteins(with short oligosaccharide side chains) and proteoglycans
(proteins with polysaccharides,glycosaminoglycans---GAGs).

## IV. Extracellular Matrix(ECM)
