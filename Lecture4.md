# Lecture 4 -- Cell Membrance

## 2. The fluidity of membrance

+ Lower organisms can adjust lipid compostion to keep membrane fluid at different env


### 2.8. Phase transition of lipid menbrane

Gel phase --> Lipid Crytal Phase


### 2.9. Adipocyte-specialized cell for lipid storage

## 3. Lipid assembly

The power of assembly. Micelle or lipid bilayer forms in aquenous solution.
Detergents, SDS ionic detergent, Trition-X-100-non-ionic detergent , NP-40-non-ionic 
Different concentration of detergent can form mic or 
Black membrane and liposome 

SDS: cover protein molecules with negative charges, fully denature protein,  dependent on the protein and SDS cont

Non-ionic detergent no denature protein , only solute protein

## 4. Membrance proteins

Type: 
	+intergral membrane proteins, 
	+perriphery proteins
	+

+ me 30% genome
+ important therapeutic targets

c. Lipid-linked rptein are made in cytosol as soluble proein
d. GPI anchor is made as transembrane protein 

Membrae protein asymmery:
+ Confomational changes of protein can occur
+ carbohydarteof glycoproty, is out

Membrane protein form domain:
+ self-assemble into aggregate
+ Tethered by outside molecules 
+ Tethered by inside molecules
+ Confined by cell-cell junctions

Example: Cytosketon nework 
Carbohydrate layer by ru

Glycoprotein
+ Lectins: 


Membrane protein mobility
+ Rotaional mobility
+ Lateral difussion
	Example 2: FRAP 	
	Example 3: FLIP (what about the curve)
	
+ Protein moblility vary gratly
	(1) soem  protein is free to move


## MEmebrane  proteins to covalently attach to membrane lipid 
+ myristoyl anchor 肉蔻
+ palmitoys anchor
+ farnesyl anchor

Toplogy
	Example 1: mitocho
	Example 2: protein G
	
	Transmenbrane alpa-helix: 
	can be predite by hydropath plot
