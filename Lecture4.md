# Lecture 4 -- Cell Membrance

## 2. The fluidity of membrance

+ Lower organisms can adjust lipid compostion to keep membrane fluid at different env


### 2.8. Phase transition of lipid menbrane

Gel phase --> Lipid Crytal Phase


### 2.9. Adipocyte-specialized cell for lipid storage

## 3. Lipid assembly

The power of assembly. Micelle or lipid bilayer forms in aquenous solution.
Detergents, SDS ionic detergent, Trition-X-100-non-ionic detergent , NP-40-non-ionic 
Different concentration of detergent can form mic or 
Black membrane and liposome 

SDS: cover protein molecules with negative charges, fully denature protein,  dependent on the protein and SDS cont

Non-ionic detergent no denature protein , only solute protein

## 4. Membrance proteins

Type: 
	+intergral membtane proteins, 
	+perriphery proteins

+ me 30% genome
+ important therapeutic targets
