# Lecture 9 Regulation of protein function


## 1. Protein complexity
+ Translation efficiency
+ Cannonical ORF mRNA, uORF-containing mRNA
+ Protein complex assembly
+ Subcellualr location
+ Protein modification

## 2. Regulation of protein function
### 1. Control of protein intrinsic activity
+ phosphorylation/dephosphorylation
+ SUmolation, Neddylation
+
+ Protease on Cys,etc
2.
3. Steady-sa\sts

Protein binding: All proteins function by binding to other molecules, which are called "ligands", latin

Non-convalent binding
+ Graded alleosteric changes
+ Non-graded alleosteric changes: turn on or off
How Src activated?

Kinases and phosphotases are most common to regulate activity.
Tyrosine, Serine, Threonine

Protein cleavage
Pro-insulin

### 2.2 Control of protein localization and local concentration
