# Lecture 7: Macromolecules transport two vesicular Traffic

## Overview of vesicular traffic
All almost contains exocytosis and endocytosis. Membrane orientation does not change during vesicular transport.

Molecules undergo exocytosis in vesicular traffic：
+ Plasma membrane proteins:
  + Cell surface receptors
  + Transporters
  + ion channels
+ Soluble protein
  + digestive enzymes
  + peptide hormones
  + collagen
  + ECM proteins, etc
+ From endosome to lysosome
  + unneeded protein
  +


  because large nutrient macromolecues is too large.

Vesicular traffic all mediated by Golgi apparatus: retrieval, secretory, endocytic pathway.

Budding vesicle as dictated by special coating protein.

Budding vesicle is dicatated by special coating protein, including Clathrin(网格蛋白), COPI, COPII.
Clathrin is made of . Adaptor proteins select cargo into clathrin-coated vesicle. Different locations for PIPs to regulate targeted vesicular transport. Membrane-bending proteins help deform the membrane during vesicle formation. Dynamin mediated

Rab proteins direct the vesicle to the correct target sites. SNARE proteins mediate the fusion of the lipid bilayer. Rad-GDP is inactive and cytosolic, usually bound to Rab-GDP-dissociation inhibitor(GDI). Rab proteins guide transport vesicle to their target membrane. Activated by membrane bound Rab-GEF(Guanine exchange factor) and become Rab-GTP(active form).
