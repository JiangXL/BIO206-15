## 3.1 Cell Culture: Where to obtain pure cell culture

### From authorative resource

Is it right to use carrer cell(HeLa) to study normal behaviral

### Isolated from tissue
Dissected tissue:

1. Take out tissue
2. Add trypin/EDTA digest,collagenase digest
(Both trypin---for animal and collagenaseis---for plant cel proteolytic enzymes,
which digest proteins in the extracellular matrix. EDTA will bind or chelate 
the Ca2+ on which cell-cell adhesion depends, which enhance the efficecy of
Trypsin)
3. Centrifuge to sediment cell aggregates(clumps)
4. Enrichment of cells by flow cytometry(cell sorting) or other enrichment
method
5. Cell cultivation

### How to enrich homo genous cells
Growth/cultivation in selective cultivation media or physical selection.

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting(**FACS**): or called flow cytometry.

**Magnetic beads-conjugated antibody**. Both negative and positive method.
Example: Add CD3-magnetic beads conjugate

**Laser capture microdissection**

Here are some guy that using bright microscopy to select cell.

### Hybridoma cell line
Fusion


## 3.2 Culture cells/ maintain a cell line
Media:

+ Buffer: pH
+ Food source: Glucose, glutmine, amino acids, nucleotides, etc
+ Serum/ growth stimulat
+ minerals for   
+ Antibiotic additives and pH indicator(?)

RPMI, MCCoy's 5A, F12, etc. Murashige & Skoog(MS) meddium is common use in 
plant cell.

2D and 3D culture: 2D monolayer, 3D spheoids grown on matrix, 3D spheroids grown
within matrix or suspension


## 3.3 Composed of Cells
Regulation, membrane dynamics, protein-protein interaction, selective transport.

Chemical Componetn of CEll
1% DNA
4% water


## 3.4 Method the study the functions of components in the cell
In order to study the function of protein in cell, here are some method to
separate and purify protein. Diffrerent matrices for different protein.

Here are some proteins isolated chromatography:

|Gel fitration | size determine
|Ion-exchange  | ? salt gradient
|Affinity      | immobilized

Protein anaysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis(**SDS-PAGE**)
SDS-Page don't seprate chain or subunits, but extend the protein structure.

2-D protein analysis: At the isoelectri point, the protein has not net charge.
First demension is isoelectric focusing, second is SDS-PAGE.
Why SDS and agarose-gel are different direction.


### How to analyze DNA/RNA
Agaros-gel
DNA/RNA can be labeled. DNA can be digoxigenin labeled, which is detected by
fluorescent dye-conjugated digoxigenin antibodies.

RNA FISH(RNA FLuo in situ hybridization?)
DNA FISH()

clone specific gene or anaylze gene expression levels?

RT-PCR(revese transcription PCR), commonly to detect RNA expression. qPCR is
uesd to quantitatively measure DNA amplification.


Cell-free system - a relatively pure system
+ An in vitro system consists from pure biomoleculers or cerll homogentate
